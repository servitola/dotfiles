# Inspect State (`node inspect` REPL Commands)

Stepping, breakpoints, and state inspection inside the `debug>` prompt — whether you launched with `node inspect` or attached with `node inspect -p <pid>`.

## Command reference

The `debug>` prompt accepts:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `c` or `cont` | continue |
| `n` or `next` | step over |
| `s` or `step` | step into |
| `o` or `out` | step out |
| `pause` | pause running code |
| `sb('file.js', 42)` | set breakpoint at file.js line 42 |
| `sb(42)` | set breakpoint at line 42 of current file |
| `sb('functionName')` | break when function is called |
| `cb('file.js', 42)` | clear breakpoint |
| `breakpoints` | list all breakpoints |
| `bt` | backtrace (call stack) |
| `list(5)` | show 5 lines of source around current position |
| `watch('expr')` | evaluate expr on every pause |
| `watchers` | show watched expressions |
| `repl` | drop into REPL in current scope (Ctrl+C to exit REPL) |
| `exec expr` | evaluate expression once |
| `restart` | restart script |
| `kill` | kill the script |
| `.exit` | quit debugger |

**In the `repl` sub-mode:** type any JS expression, including access to locals/closure variables. `Ctrl+C` exits back to `debug>`.

## Pitfalls

1. **Background kills.** If you `Ctrl+C` out of `node inspect` while the target is paused, the target stays paused. Either `cont` first, or `kill` the target explicitly.

2. **Running `node inspect` through an agent terminal.** It's a PTY-friendly REPL. Launch it in a background/interactive shell that lets you send subsequent commands to the same process. Non-PTY foreground mode will work for one-shot commands but not for interactive stepping.

## One-Shot Recipes

**"Why is this variable undefined at line X?"**
```bash
node --inspect-brk script.js &
node inspect -p $!
# debug>
sb('script.js', X)
cont
# paused. Now:
repl
> myVariable
> Object.keys(this)
```

**"What's the call path into this function?"**
```
debug> sb('suspectFn')
debug> cont
# paused on entry
debug> bt
```

**"This async chain hangs — where?"**
```
# Start with --inspect (no -brk), let it run to the hang, then:
debug> pause
debug> bt
# Now you see the stuck frame
```

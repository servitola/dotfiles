  Validates task files against codebase reality: file/function existence, feasibility,
  hallucinations, basic security, TDD adequacy, implementation hints accuracy.

  Use when: validating task files after task-creator generates them,
  during /decompose-tech-spec validation phase.
  Not for: template compliance (task-validator), deep security audit (security-auditor).

Validate task files against codebase reality. Catch mismatches between task descriptions and actual code.

## Input

- feature_path: Path to feature folder (e.g., `work/my-feature`)
- task_numbers: Array of task numbers to validate (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`)
- batch_number: Batch number for report naming (default: 1)
- iteration: Validation iteration number (default: 1)

## Process

1. Read context:
   - `{feature_path}/tech-spec.md`
   - `{feature_path}/user-spec.md` (if exists)

2. For each task in task_numbers — read `{feature_path}/tasks/{N}.md`

3. For each task — validate against checklist below. Use Glob/Grep/Read to verify claims against actual codebase.

4. Write JSON report.

Err on the side of flagging issues. A false positive that gets reviewed and dismissed is far cheaper than a false negative that produces a bad artifact. When in doubt, create a finding.

## Validation Checklist

### A. Reality (skeptic)

For each file/function/class/module referenced in the task:
- [ ] File exists at specified path (use Glob)
- [ ] Functions/methods/classes mentioned actually exist in that file (use Grep/Read)
- [ ] Import paths are correct
- [ ] Dependencies (npm packages, pip packages, etc.) are installed or explicitly planned for installation in the task

### B. Feasibility

- [ ] "What to do" steps are concrete and actionable (not "implement the feature")
- [ ] Steps don't contradict current code architecture
- [ ] Steps reference correct APIs/patterns used in the project
- [ ] Order of steps makes sense (no circular dependencies within a task)
- [ ] If task references files that will be modified by a dependency task, verify the dependency is correctly declared in `depends_on`. A task that reads a file created by another task without declaring that dependency → severity `critical`

### C. Hallucinations

- [ ] No references to non-existent APIs, endpoints, or modules
- [ ] No invented function signatures that don't match actual code
- [ ] No assumptions about project patterns that don't exist (check actual patterns)

### D. Basic Security

- [ ] Input validation is planned where user data is handled
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in implementation hints
- [ ] Auth-related tasks are scheduled before dependent tasks (check depends_on/wave)
- [ ] SQL queries use parameterized statements (if applicable)

### E. TDD Adequacy

- [ ] Tests check real behavior, not just mocks
- [ ] TDD Anchor covers main scenarios from Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test file paths follow project's test structure (check actual test directories)

### F. Cross-Task Integration

When validating ALL tasks in a single batch (cross-task mode from task-decomposition):

- [ ] Same heavy resource (ML model, DB connection pool, browser instance, API client) is initialized in multiple tasks without a shared instance plan in tech-spec Shared Resources → severity `critical`
- [ ] Tech-spec Shared Resources lists a resource, but no task is designated as the owner (creator) → severity `critical`
- [ ] Consumer task does not declare `depends_on` on the owner task for a shared resource → severity `critical`
- [ ] Tasks in the same wave use inconsistent approaches to the same problem (different patterns, different libraries for same purpose) → severity `major`
- [ ] Task reads/imports a module created by another task without declaring dependency → severity `critical`

### G. Implementation Hints

- [ ] Hints reference actual patterns from the codebase
- [ ] Suggested approaches match current project conventions
- [ ] No outdated references (e.g., deprecated APIs, old config formats)
- [ ] Hints are hints, not implementations. If implementation hints contain pseudocode, step-by-step algorithms, or code blocks with full logic → severity `major`, category `hints`. Hints should point to patterns and approaches, not prescribe the solution

## Severity Guide

| Severity | When |
|----------|------|
| critical | File/function doesn't exist; hallucinated API; security vulnerability; infeasible steps; duplicate heavy resource across tasks; missing cross-task dependency |
| major | Hints slightly outdated; test path doesn't match convention; pattern mismatch; inconsistent approaches across tasks |
| minor | Could reference a better pattern; hint could be more specific |

## Output

Write JSON report to `{feature_path}/logs/tasks/reality-batch{batch_number}-review.json`:

```json
{
  "validator": "reality-checker",
  "batch": [1, 2, 3],
  "status": "approved | changes_required",
  "findings": [
    {
      "severity": "critical | major | minor",
      "category": "missing_file | missing_function | hallucination | security | tdd | feasibility | hints | cross-task-integration",
      "task": 2,
      "issue": "Task references getUser() in src/api/users.ts, but file only has fetchUser()",
      "fix": "Replace getUser() with fetchUser() or add getUser() wrapper"
    }
  ],
  "stats": {
    "tasks_checked": 3,
    "claims_verified": 24,
    "issues_found": 1
  }
}
```

`status: approved` when zero critical findings. `status: changes_required` when any critical finding exists.

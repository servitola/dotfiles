  Prescriptive test quality analysis: finds problems and provides concrete fixes.
  Analyzes written test code, test strategy from tech-spec, or both.
  Orchestrator specifies what to check and provides file paths.

Follow the test-master skill methodology. Read references/test-quality-review.md for detailed review criteria.

## Input

Orchestrator provides:
- What to check: test file paths, implementation file paths, or tech-spec path
- `report_path`: where to write JSON report

## Process

1. Read test-quality-review.md from preloaded test-master skill
2. Read all provided files (tests, implementation, tech-spec — whatever is given)
3. For each test, apply litmus test: "if core logic line removed, does test fail?"
4. Analyze each test against 6 categories of bad tests
5. Check test pyramid balance and coverage adequacy
6. For TDD anchors in tech-spec tasks: check test quality, not just presence (see TDD Anchor Quality below)
7. For each finding — provide prescriptive fix (approach + assertions + mock changes)
8. Categorize findings by severity
9. Determine status using decision matrix
10. Write JSON report to `report_path`

Err on the side of flagging issues. A false positive that gets reviewed and dismissed is far cheaper than a false negative that produces a bad artifact. When in doubt, create a finding.

### TDD Anchor Quality (tech-spec and task review mode)

When reviewing TDD anchors in tech-spec tasks or task files:
- Anchors that only test string/substring presence (e.g., `assert "keyword" in prompt_text`, `assert "section_name" in output`) → category `empty_test`, severity `major`. These verify structure, not behavior.
- Prompt-related test strategies that only check substring presence should be flagged as insufficient. Meaningful prompt tests verify behavior: output format, handling of edge inputs, correct routing — not whether a keyword appears in the prompt string.
- Each TDD anchor should describe a behavioral assertion. "Test that function returns X when given Y" is good. "Test that prompt contains word Z" is not.

## Output

Write JSON report to `report_path`. Same format for test code review and strategy review. Orchestrator parses this JSON to build consolidated reports.

```json
{
  "status": "passed | needs_improvement | failed",
  "summary": "Brief assessment of overall test quality",
  "findings": [
    {
      "severity": "critical | major | minor",
      "category": "empty_test | mock_only | missing_coverage | pyramid_violation | excessive_mocking | anti_pattern | wrong_test_type | redundant_testing",
      "location": "src/tests/auth.test.ts:42 | Section: Testing Strategy | Component: Auth module",
      "issue": "Description of the problem",
      "recommendation": "Specific fix with concrete assertions or strategy change"
    }
  ],
  "metrics": {
    "filesReviewed": 5,
    "litmusTest": {
      "checked": 12,
      "passed": 8,
      "failed": 4
    },
    "coverageAssessment": "insufficient | adequate | excellent",
    "pyramidBalance": {
      "unit": 10,
      "integration": 3,
      "e2e": 1,
      "assessment": "healthy | inverted | unbalanced"
    }
  }
}
```

`location` adapts to context:
- Test code review: file path with line number (`src/tests/auth.test.ts:42`)
- Strategy review: section or component reference (`Section: Testing Strategy`, `Component: Auth module`)

### Status Decision

- `passed` — zero critical, zero major findings
- `needs_improvement` — zero critical, 1-2 major or multiple minor findings
- `failed` — one or more critical, or 3+ major findings

# Artifact Format and HTML / CSS / JS Standards

## Artifact Format Rules

Default to local files.

For standalone artifacts:

- create a descriptive filename, e.g. `Landing Page.html`, `Command Palette Prototype.html`, `Design System Board.html`
- embed CSS in `<style>`
- embed JS in `<script>`
- keep the artifact openable directly in a browser
- avoid remote dependencies unless they are explicitly useful and stable
- include responsive behavior unless the format is intentionally fixed-size

For significant revisions:

- preserve the previous version as `Name.html`
- create `Name v2.html`, `Name v3.html`, etc.
- or keep one file with in-page toggles if the assignment is variant exploration

For repo implementation:

- follow the repo's actual stack
- use existing components and tokens where possible
- do not create a standalone artifact if the user asked for production code

## HTML / CSS / JS Standards

Use modern CSS well:

- CSS variables for tokens
- CSS grid for layout
- container queries when helpful
- `text-wrap: pretty` where supported
- real focus states
- real hover states
- `prefers-reduced-motion` handling for non-trivial motion
- responsive scaling
- semantic HTML where practical

Avoid:

- huge monolithic files when a real repo structure is expected
- fragile hard-coded viewport assumptions
- inaccessible tiny hit targets
- decorative JS that fights usability
- `scrollIntoView` unless there is no safer option

Mobile hit targets should be at least 44px.

For print documents, text should be at least 12pt.

For 1920×1080 slide decks, text should generally be 24px or larger.

## React Guidance for Standalone HTML

Use plain HTML/CSS/JS by default.

Use React only when:

- the artifact needs meaningful state
- variants/toggles are easier as components
- interaction complexity warrants it
- the target implementation is React/Next.js and fidelity matters

If using React from CDN in standalone HTML:

- pin exact versions
- avoid unpinned `react@18` style URLs
- avoid `type="module"` unless necessary
- avoid multiple global objects named `styles`
- give global style objects specific names, e.g. `commandPaletteStyles`, `deckStyles`
- if splitting Babel scripts, explicitly attach shared components to `window`

If building inside a real repo, use the repo's package manager and component architecture instead.

# Developer Profile & Preferences

- No comments in code! Code itself should be self-explanatory
- Gruvbox Dark Hard theme
- Prioritize memory efficiency and UI responsiveness
-. Write modular code, using separate files for models, data loading, training, and evaluation

# Project Structure Rules

1. For any project feature:
   - Read and follow root `.windsurfrules` first
   - Then read feature-specific `.windsurfrules`
   - Use feature directory as root when working with that feature

2. Project-specific configurations should be in their respective directories
3. Use colima instead of Docker Desktop
4. If we create a project, we use crewai to create and manipulate teams of ai who do all the routine.

# Communication Preferences

- Presentation: Prefer concise bullet points for explanations
- Solutions: Present multiple options for complex problems, with recommendations
- Response Style: Direct and actionable without unnecessary elaboration
- Technical Level: Assume advanced technical knowledge, don't explain basic concepts

## Step 7.1: Conference Checklist

Every venue has mandatory checklists. Complete them carefully — incomplete checklists can result in desk rejection.

See [checklists.md](checklists.md) for:
- NeurIPS 16-item paper checklist
- ICML broader impact + reproducibility
- ICLR LLM disclosure policy
- ACL mandatory limitations section
- Universal pre-submission checklist

## Step 7.2: Anonymization Checklist

Double-blind review means reviewers cannot know who wrote the paper. Check ALL of these:

```
Anonymization Checklist:
- [ ] No author names or affiliations anywhere in the PDF
- [ ] No acknowledgments section (add after acceptance)
- [ ] Self-citations written in third person: "Smith et al. [1] showed..." not "We previously showed [1]..."
- [ ] No GitHub/GitLab URLs pointing to your personal repos
- [ ] Use Anonymous GitHub (https://anonymous.4open.science/) for code links
- [ ] No institutional logos or identifiers in figures
- [ ] No file metadata containing author names (check PDF properties)
- [ ] No "our previous work" or "in our earlier paper" phrasing
- [ ] Dataset names don't reveal institution (rename if needed)
- [ ] Supplementary materials don't contain identifying information
```

**Common mistakes**: Git commit messages visible in supplementary code, watermarked figures from institutional tools, acknowledgments left in from a previous draft, arXiv preprint posted before anonymity period.

## Step 7.3: Formatting Verification

```
Pre-Submission Format Check:
- [ ] Page limit respected (excluding references and appendix)
- [ ] All figures are vector (PDF) or high-res raster (600 DPI PNG)
- [ ] All figures readable in grayscale
- [ ] All tables use booktabs
- [ ] References compile correctly (no "?" in citations)
- [ ] No overfull hboxes in critical areas
- [ ] Appendix clearly labeled and separated
- [ ] Required sections present (limitations, broader impact, etc.)
```

## Step 7.4: Pre-Compilation Validation

Run these automated checks **before** attempting `pdflatex`. Catching errors here is faster than debugging compiler output.

```bash
# 1. Lint with chktex (catches common LaTeX mistakes)
# Suppress noisy warnings: -n2 (sentence end), -n24 (parens), -n13 (intersentence), -n1 (command terminated)
chktex main.tex -q -n2 -n24 -n13 -n1

# 2. Verify all citations exist in .bib
# Extract \cite{...} from .tex, check each against .bib
python3 -c "
import re
tex = open('main.tex').read()
bib = open('references.bib').read()
cites = set(re.findall(r'\\\\cite[tp]?{([^}]+)}', tex))
for cite_group in cites:
    for cite in cite_group.split(','):
        cite = cite.strip()
        if cite and cite not in bib:
            print(f'WARNING: \\\\cite{{{cite}}} not found in references.bib')
"

# 3. Verify all referenced figures exist on disk
python3 -c "
import re, os
tex = open('main.tex').read()
figs = re.findall(r'\\\\includegraphics(?:\[.*?\])?{([^}]+)}', tex)
for fig in figs:
    if not os.path.exists(fig):
        print(f'WARNING: Figure file not found: {fig}')
"

# 4. Check for duplicate \label definitions
python3 -c "
import re
from collections import Counter
tex = open('main.tex').read()
labels = re.findall(r'\\\\label{([^}]+)}', tex)
dupes = {k: v for k, v in Counter(labels).items() if v > 1}
for label, count in dupes.items():
    print(f'WARNING: Duplicate label: {label} (appears {count} times)')
"
```

Fix any warnings before proceeding. For agent-based workflows: feed chktex output back to the agent with instructions to make minimal fixes.

## Step 7.5: Final Compilation

```bash
# Clean build
rm -f *.aux *.bbl *.blg *.log *.out *.pdf
latexmk -pdf main.tex

# Or manual (triple pdflatex + bibtex for cross-references)
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode main.tex
bibtex main
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode main.tex
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode main.tex

# Verify output exists and has content
ls -la main.pdf
```

**If compilation fails**: Parse the `.log` file for the first error. Common fixes:
- "Undefined control sequence" → missing package or typo in command name
- "Missing $ inserted" → math symbol outside math mode
- "File not found" → wrong figure path or missing .sty file
- "Citation undefined" → .bib entry missing or bibtex not run

## Step 7.6: Conference-Specific Requirements

| Venue | Special Requirements |
|-------|---------------------|
| **NeurIPS** | Paper checklist in appendix, lay summary if accepted |
| **ICML** | Broader Impact Statement (after conclusion, doesn't count toward limit) |
| **ICLR** | LLM disclosure required, reciprocal reviewing agreement |
| **ACL** | Mandatory Limitations section, Responsible NLP checklist |
| **AAAI** | Strict style file — no modifications whatsoever |
| **COLM** | Frame contribution for language model community |

## Step 7.7: Conference Resubmission & Format Conversion

When converting between venues, **never copy LaTeX preambles between templates**:

```bash
# 1. Start fresh with target template
cp -r templates/icml2026/ new_submission/

# 2. Copy ONLY content sections (not preamble)
#    - Abstract text, section content, figures, tables, bib entries

# 3. Adjust for page limits
# 4. Add venue-specific required sections
# 5. Update references
```

| From → To | Page Change | Key Adjustments |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| NeurIPS → ICML | 9 → 8 | Cut 1 page, add Broader Impact |
| ICML → ICLR | 8 → 9 | Expand experiments, add LLM disclosure |
| NeurIPS → ACL | 9 → 8 | Restructure for NLP conventions, add Limitations |
| ICLR → AAAI | 9 → 7 | Significant cuts, strict style adherence |
| Any → COLM | varies → 9 | Reframe for language model focus |

When cutting pages: move proofs to appendix, condense related work, combine tables, use subfigures (see [paper-drafting.md](paper-drafting.md), "Page Budget Management").
When expanding: add ablations, expand limitations, include additional baselines, add qualitative examples.

**After rejection**: Address reviewer concerns in the new version, but don't include a "changes" section or reference the previous submission (blind review).

## Step 7.8: Camera-Ready Preparation (Post-Acceptance)

After acceptance, prepare the camera-ready version:

```
Camera-Ready Checklist:
- [ ] De-anonymize: add author names, affiliations, email addresses
- [ ] Add Acknowledgments section (funding, compute grants, helpful reviewers)
- [ ] Add public code/data URL (real GitHub, not anonymous)
- [ ] Address any mandatory revisions from meta-reviewer
- [ ] Switch template to camera-ready mode (if applicable — e.g., AAAI \anon → \camera)
- [ ] Add copyright notice if required by venue
- [ ] Update any "anonymous" placeholders in text
- [ ] Verify final PDF compiles cleanly
- [ ] Check page limit for camera-ready (sometimes differs from submission)
- [ ] Upload supplementary materials (code, data, appendix) to venue portal
```

## Step 7.9: arXiv & Preprint Strategy

Posting to arXiv is standard practice in ML but has important timing and anonymity considerations.

**Timing decision tree:**

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Submitting to double-blind venue (NeurIPS, ICML, ACL) | Post to arXiv **after** submission deadline, not before. Posting before can technically violate anonymity policies, though enforcement varies. |
| Submitting to ICLR | ICLR explicitly allows arXiv posting before submission. But don't put author names in the submission itself. |
| Paper already on arXiv, submitting to new venue | Acceptable at most venues. Do NOT update arXiv version during review with changes that reference reviews. |
| Workshop paper | arXiv is fine at any time — workshops are typically not double-blind. |
| Want to establish priority | Post immediately if scooping is a concern — but accept the anonymity tradeoff. |

**arXiv category selection** (ML/AI papers):

| Category | Code | Best For |
|----------|------|----------|
| Machine Learning | `cs.LG` | General ML methods |
| Computation and Language | `cs.CL` | NLP, language models |
| Artificial Intelligence | `cs.AI` | Reasoning, planning, agents |
| Computer Vision | `cs.CV` | Vision models |
| Information Retrieval | `cs.IR` | Search, recommendation |

**List primary + 1-2 cross-listed categories.** More categories = more visibility, but only cross-list where genuinely relevant.

**Versioning strategy:**
- **v1**: Initial submission (matches conference submission)
- **v2**: Post-acceptance with camera-ready corrections (add "accepted at [Venue]" to abstract)
- Don't post v2 during the review period with changes that clearly respond to reviewer feedback

```bash
# Check if your paper's title is already taken on arXiv
# (before choosing a title)
pip install arxiv
python -c "
import arxiv
results = list(arxiv.Search(query='ti:\"Your Exact Title\"', max_results=5).results())
print(f'Found {len(results)} matches')
for r in results: print(f'  {r.title} ({r.published.year})')
"
```

## Step 7.10: Research Code Packaging

Releasing clean, runnable code significantly increases citations and reviewer trust. Package code alongside the camera-ready submission.

**Repository structure:**

```
your-method/
  README.md              # Setup, usage, reproduction instructions
  requirements.txt       # Or environment.yml for conda
  setup.py               # For pip-installable packages
  LICENSE                # MIT or Apache 2.0 recommended for research
  configs/               # Experiment configurations
  src/                   # Core method implementation
  scripts/               # Training, evaluation, analysis scripts
    train.py
    evaluate.py
    reproduce_table1.sh  # One script per main result
  data/                  # Small data or download scripts
    download_data.sh
  results/               # Expected outputs for verification
```

**README template for research code:**

```markdown
# [Paper Title]

Official implementation of "[Paper Title]" (Venue Year).

## Setup
[Exact commands to set up environment]

## Reproduction
To reproduce Table 1: `bash scripts/reproduce_table1.sh`
To reproduce Figure 2: `python scripts/make_figure2.py`

## Citation
[BibTeX entry]
```

**Pre-release checklist:**
```
- [ ] Code runs from a clean clone (test on fresh machine or Docker)
- [ ] All dependencies pinned to specific versions
- [ ] No hardcoded absolute paths
- [ ] No API keys, credentials, or personal data in repo
- [ ] README covers setup, reproduction, and citation
- [ ] LICENSE file present (MIT or Apache 2.0 for max reuse)
- [ ] Results are reproducible within expected variance
- [ ] .gitignore excludes data files, checkpoints, logs
```

**Anonymous code for submission** (before acceptance):
```bash
# Use Anonymous GitHub for double-blind review
# https://anonymous.4open.science/
# Upload your repo → get an anonymous URL → put in paper
```

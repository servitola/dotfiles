# Agent Guidelines for Dotfiles Repository

These dotfiles are an operating system on top of macOS. Not just a set of configs, but a living, evolving workspace management system.

**New here? Read `docs/repo-map.md`** — it tiers every directory by importance
(Core / Important / Secondary / Peripheral / Experiment), so you know what
matters and what's just an experiment. Each directory also has its own
`AGENTS.md` with operational detail.

## Build/Test Commands
- `make` - Full dotfiles installation & symlink setup
- `up` - System-wide update & cleanup (brew, npm, macOS, cache)

## Architecture & Structure
- **Dotfiles repo**: Configuration files symlinked to system locations (~/.zshrc, ~/.gitconfig, etc.)
- **Package management**: Homebrew with brewfile for app installations and documentation in `/opt/homebrew/docs/`
- **Automation**: Hammerspoon for window management, URL routing, keyboard layouts
- **Keyboard**: Karabiner-Elements for advanced keyboard customization
- **Shell**: Zsh + Oh My Zsh with extensive plugin ecosystem
- **No databases or APIs**: Pure configuration repository
- **Symlinks**: Created via Makefile (e.g., ~/.gitconfig → git/gitconfig; app configs link to respective directories)
- **Reference**: See `README.md` for detailed setup

## AI Coding Tools — Shared Configuration
Claude Code (`claude-code/`) is the single source of truth for `commands/`, `agents/`, `skills/`; Amp, Qwen Code, and Codex consume them via Makefile symlinks. Codex keeps its own global config in `codex/`.
When adding new shared commands, agents, or skills — add them to `claude-code/` only.
Detached (opt-in, per-folder) skills and MCP servers live in `claude-code/detached_skills/` and `claude-code/detached_mcp/` — attach with `skill-attach <name> [dir]` / `mcp-attach <name> [dir]`.
Full symlink map, tool-specific configs, and Codex operational rules (1024-char description limit, vendored `openai-docs`, install via cask only): see `claude-code/AGENTS.md`.
Never `brew uninstall --zap codex` — its zap stanza deletes `~/.codex`.

## Code Style Guidelines
- **Theme**: Gruvbox Dark Hard
- **Fail-fast philosophy**: Do NOT add existence checks for dependencies, tools, or paths. If something required is missing, the script should fail loudly. This is intentional — it surfaces setup issues immediately.
- **Linting**: No linting required - this is a configuration repository (shell scripts, Lua scripts, dotfiles)

## Adding New Applications/Tools

See `docs/app-integration.md` for detailed integration guide.

## Keyboard Setup

See `docs/keyboard-setup.md` for complete keyboard customization documentation.

## Documentation Structure
- **docs/** - Specialized guides that AI can read selectively when needed
- Reference by plain path in backticks (`` `docs/filename.md` ``) — NEVER via `@path` import syntax: `@` force-loads the file into every session's context, recursively following the imported file's own `@` refs
